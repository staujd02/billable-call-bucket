1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to abide by these Terms and Conditions and any additional guidelines or rules we may provide.

2. Changes to Terms

We may modify these Terms and Conditions at any time. You will be notified of any changes, and it is your responsibility to review these terms periodically. Your continued use of the App after any modifications indicates your acceptance of the revised terms.

5. Indemnity Clause

You agree to indemnify and hold Stauffer Software, its affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees, agents, and licensors harmless from any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising out of or in connection with:

    a. Your use of the Bill-worthy Call Organizer.

6. Severability Clause

In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, the unenforceability or invalidity of such provision shall not render these Terms of Service unenforceable or invalid as a whole. Instead, the unenforceable or invalid provision shall be severed from these Terms of Service, and all remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. Any such severed provision shall be replaced with a valid provision that comes as close as possible to the original intention of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms of Service shall remain in effect.`;
